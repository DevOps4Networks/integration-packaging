Welcome to the OpenDaylight Integration Packaging project.

This project uses a combination of [Packer](https://www.packer.io), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Ansible] to create VMs that can be used to testing, developing, learning and teching on the [OpenDaylight platform](https://www.opendaylight.org).
